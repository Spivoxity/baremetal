# Bare metal micro:bit
Source code for use with the book 'Bare Metal micro:bit'.

This copy of the repository has code that suits the original, Version
1 of the BBC micro:bit, based on the Nordic nRF51822 chip.

Draft material for the book will appear at https://spivey.oriel.ox.ac.uk/baremetal.

The book is in a rapid phase of evolution at present, and the code and
text will not always be in sync -- in particular, code will appear
here for testing while the corresponding chapter is still being
written.
